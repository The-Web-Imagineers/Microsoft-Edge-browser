## Step 1: Create a branch

_Welcome to "Introduction to GitHub"! :wave:_

**What is GitHub?**: GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses _[Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git)_ for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to [open-source](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source) software.

**What is a repository?**: A _[repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository)_ is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders. For more information, see "[About repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)" from GitHub Docs.

**What is a branch?**: A _[branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch)_ is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named `main` and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the `main` branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.

Branches allow you to separate your work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute. For more information, see "[About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)".

**What is a profile README?**: A _[profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)_ is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page. For more information, see "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)".

3. Click on the **main** branch drop-down.Sure, here's an article about the versions of Internet Explorer:

# The Evolution of Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer, often abbreviated as IE, was a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems.

## Internet Explorer 1.0

Internet Explorer 1.0 was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in August 1995. It was a reworked version of Spyglass Mosaic which Microsoft had licensed.

## Internet Explorer 3.0

Internet Explorer 3.0, released in 1996, was the first version to provide a full browsing experience, with support for background sounds, images, tables, and other HTML enhancements.

## Internet Explorer 5.0

Internet Explorer 5.0, released in 1999, was the first version to integrate more closely with Windows, allowing users to browse the web directly from the Windows desktop.

## Internet Explorer 6.0

Internet Explorer 6.0, released in 2001, was the most widely used web browser during its tenure (surpassing Netscape). It was the last version to be based on the Trident layout engine.

## Internet Explorer 7.0

Internet Explorer 7.0, released in 2006, was the first version to include tabbed browsing, a highly requested feature at the time.

## Internet Explorer 8.0

Internet Explorer 8.0, released in 2009, added several new features, including a search box and improved security.

## Internet Explorer 9.0

Internet Explorer 9.0, released in 2011, was the first version to support HTML5 and CSS3.

## Internet Explorer 10.0

Internet Explorer 10.0, released in 2012, was the first version to be included with Windows 8.

## Internet Explorer 11.0

Internet Explorer 11.0, released in 2013, is the final version of Internet Explorer. It was officially discontinued in June 2022.

In conclusion, Internet Explorer has had a long and storied history, from its inception in 1995 to its final version in 2013. Despite being discontinued, it played a significant role in shaping the internet as we know it today.

   ![create-branch-button](/images/create-branch-button.png)

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
