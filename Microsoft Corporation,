### 1. Setting Environment Variables:
You can set custom environment variables in your GitHub Actions workflow file using the `env` keyword. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: Github Actions test
on: [push]
env:
  ENV_VARIABLE: test
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "$ENV_VARIABLE"
```

In this example, `ENV_VARIABLE` is an environment variable set to `test`.

### 2. Accessing Environment Variables:
You can reference custom environment variables in the `run` command using either the `env` wrapper or the variable name directly. In the example above, `ENV_VARIABLE` is accessed in the `echo` command.

### 3. Default Environment Variables:
GitHub provides default variables for each GitHub Actions workflow run, like `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_REF`. You can use these in the `run` command using the `env` wrapper.

### 4. Environment Variables Scope:
The scope of a custom variable is limited to the element in which it is defined. You can define variables for the entire workflow, a specific job, or a step within a job.

### 5. Using Environment Variables in Different Environments:
Configure environments with protection rules and secrets. Ensure that a workflow job follows protection rules for the environment before running or accessing the environment's secrets.

Remember, for sensitive information like passwords, use secrets for greater security. GitHub Actions documentation and tutorial videos¹²³ can provide more detailed information.
